# discord.py-animelist-bot
Simple Discord bot written in Python that allows server members to add, edit, and remove recommendations for any medium of entertainment to other users.

The code is intended to be run in replit.com. There are references/comments in the code where replit functionality is being used. Steps for setting up replit here:
https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/using-replit-free
You will create files in your replit that match the files in this repository.

You will also need a mongoDB database for storing recommendations. You can create and maintain a mongoDB database through the free tier of Mongo Atlas. Steps to follow can be found here:

You will need to edit the code to fit the collection and clusters you create. Comments in the code identify areas where the mongo set up is happening. 


The code in this repo will serve as a skeleton that needs to be built upon for a custom bot. The utility functions and structure for Mongo connections are the most important bit that will likely need to be customized.
